Running the Tests
-----------------
The tests are run via

    python setup.py nosetests

To also run the component tests, you need to initialize the git submodules once
via:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

This will fetch the necessary binary data for the DEB and RPM component tests,
and the tests are from now on included within each regular test run.


Building the API Docs
---------------------
You can build the API docs using

    epydoc -v --config=setup.cfg


Contributing Patches
--------------------
Make sure the tests pass before sending in patch. You can either send it to the
mailing list or add it to a bug report against git-buildpackage on

    http://bugs.debian.org/src:git-buildpackage
