  <title>Working with Patches</title>

  <para>
    &gbp-pq; can be used to manage patches that modify the upstream
    source inside
    <filename>debian/patches/</filename>. This is mostly intended for
    3.0 (quilt) format source packages.
  </para>

  <para>
    The basic idea is that patches are imported from your
    &debian-branch; to a patch-queue branch with one patch file
    in <filename>debian/patches/</filename> becoming one commit on the
    the patch-queue branch.  The created branch will be named after
    the branch you imported from
    with <filename>patch-queue/</filename> prepended. So if you do
    your &debian; packaging on <filename>debian/sid</filename> and do
    a
  </para>
<programlisting>
    &gbp-pq-import;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    then the newly created branch will be
    called <filename>patch-queue/debian/sid</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>On the patch-queue branch you can work on the commits using
    familiar &git; commands (rebase, commit --amend, etc). When done,
    &gbp-pq; will be used to turn the commits on the patch-queue
    branch into patch in <filename>debian/patches/</filename> files
    again.
  </para>

  <para>
    This workflow facilitates e.g. the cherry-picking of patches for
    stable releases, the forward-porting of patches to new upstream
    versions by using git rebase on the patch-queue branch (patches
    already applied upstream are detected automatically) as well as
    the reordering, dropping and renaming of patches without having to
    resort to &quilt;.  The generated patches
    in <filename>debian/patches/</filename> have all the necessary
    information to forward them upstream since they use a format similar
    to <command>git-format-patch</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The main drawback of this workflow is the lack of history on the
    patch-queue branch since it is frequently droppend and
    recreated. But there is full history on
    the your &debian-branch;, of course.
  </para>

  <para>
    Also, beware that &gbp-pq; currently has incomplete support for
    <ulink url="https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep3/">DEP3</ulink> headers.
    Initially, parsing with <command>git-mailinfo(1)</command> is attempted,
    which supports only the <computeroutput>From</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>Subject</computeroutput> fields. If neither of these are
    present, &gbp-pq; will attempt to convert the patch from DEP3 format into
    a <command>git-mailinfo(1)</command> compatible format. This involves first
    loading <computeroutput>From</computeroutput> using the
    <computeroutput>Author</computeroutput> field and
    <computeroutput>Subject</computeroutput> using the first line of the
    <computeroutput>Description</computeroutput> field. Then,  any additional
    fields (such as <computeroutput>Origin</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>Forwarded</computeroutput>), and the remainder of the
    <computeroutput>Description</computeroutput> (if any), will be appended to
    the body.
  </para>

    <title>Basic Workflow</title>

    <para>
      This example assumes you're working on a source 3.0 (quilt)
      format package with patches
      in <filename>debian/patches</filename> parseable
      by <command>git-quiltimport(1)</command>. The git branch
      currently checked out is named <filename>debian/sid</filename>.
    </para>

      <caption>
	<para>
	  The &debian-branch; we start from.
	</para>
      </caption>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Let's first create the patch-queue branch and import the
      contents of <filename>debian/patches</filename> onto it using
      &gbp-pq;
    </para>

<programlisting>
  <command>cd <replaceable>REPO</replaceable></command>
  &gbp-pq; import
</programlisting>

<para>
  This will generate output like:
<screen>
    gbp:info: Trying to apply patches at 'aaa1011bfd5aa74fea43620aae94709de05f80be'
    gbp:info: 18 patches listed in 'debian/patches/series' imported on 'patch-queue/debian/sid'
</screen>
  What happened is that &gbp-pq; imported each patch file and switched
  you to the newly created patch-queue branch
  (<filename>patch-queue/debian/sid</filename>) automatically.
</para>

  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>

      <para>
	The patch-queue branch with patches
	from <filename>debian/patches</filename> applied.
      </para>
    </caption>
  </mediaobject>

<para>
  Now you can work on the patch-queue branch (add, remove, rebase,
  test) to get your patches into shape:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	To add what will later become a patch
	in <filename>debian/patches/</filename> simply make a
	commit. The first line of the commit message will become the
	patch name later.  The following lines include the details of
	what the patch does.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	To remove or edit commits use git rebase -i . The git
	documentation explains how to work with git-rebase.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
  Once satisfied with the commits let's regenerate the patches
  in <filename>debian/patches/</filename> using &gbp-pq;. This will
  switch you back to the branch <filename>debian/sid</filename> and
  regenerate the patches using a method similar
  to <command>git-format-patch</command>:
</para>

<programlisting>
  &gbp-pq; export
</programlisting>

<para>You can now commit the result by using:</para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; add debian/patches
  &gitcmd; commit
</programlisting>
<para>
  If you don't want to commit the result by hand each time you can also
  pass <option>--commit</option> to the &gbp; <option>export</option>
  command above.
</para>

<para>
  Next you can update <filename>debian/changelog</filename> (e.g. by
  running "&gbp-dch; <option>-S</option> <option>-a</option>") and
  build the package as usual.
</para>

    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>
    But don't worry if you forgot to do so before importing the new
    version (or if another team member imported the version already).
  </para>

  <para>
    In this case you can make &gbp-pq; figure out where to apply the
    patches by using the <option>--time-machine=</option> option. The
    following command
  </para>

<programlisting>
    &gbp-pq-import; --force --time-machine=10
</programlisting>

  <para>
    would drop your current patch-queue branch (if existent) and
    create a new one by going back in your commit history as far as 10
    commits to find a place where your patches still
    apply <footnote><para>This is not necessarily
    your debian-branch; HEAD since the new upstream
    version might have changed so that the patches no longer apply
    cleanly there.</para></footnote>. If it finds such a commit on
    your &debian-branch; it will create the patch-queue branch from
    there and switch you to that branch. You can now rework your
    patches to apply to the new upstream version by using
    &gbp-pq-rebase;:

  or you can invoke &gitcmd; <option>rebase</option> directly:
</para>

<programlisting>
    &gitcmd; rebase -i debian/sid
</programlisting>

  <para>
    Should the rebase fail (e.g. because the upstream source changed
    at the same place your patches modify the code) you can resolve
    this by using  the options of &gitcmd; <option>rebase</option> (if
    you simply want to abort use
    &gitcmd; <option>rebase</option> <option>--abort</option>).

    Once done you can export your commits to patch files again:
