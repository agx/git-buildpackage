    <title>Handling non-DFSG clean upstream sources</title>
    <para>If you have to handle non-DFSG clean upstream sources, you can use a
    different branch which you have to create once:
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; branch dfsg_clean upstream
</programlisting>
    <para>
    This creates the <emphasis>dfsg_clean</emphasis> branch from the tip of a
    branch called <emphasis>upstream</emphasis>.  Then, when importing a new
    upstream version, you import the new version on the
    <option>upstream-branch</option> (by default named
    <emphasis>upstream</emphasis>) as usual and just don't merge to the
    <emphasis>debian-branch</emphasis>  (by default named
    <emphasis>master</emphasis>):
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gbp-import-orig; --no-merge <filename>/path/to/nondfsg-clean-package_10.4.orig.tar.gz</filename>
  &gitcmd; <option>tag</option> 10.4
</programlisting>
    <para>
    After the import, you can switch to the <emphasis>dfsg_clean</emphasis>
    branch and get the newly imported changes from the upstream branch:
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; <option>checkout</option> dfsg_clean
  &gitcmd; <option>pull</option> <filename>.</filename> upstream
</programlisting>
    <para>Now make this checkout dfsg clean (preferably by a cleanup script), commit
    your changes and merge to your <option>debian-branch</option>:</para>
<programlisting>
  cleanup-script.sh
  &gitcmd; commit -a -m "Make source dfsg clean"
  &gitcmd; tag <replaceable>10.4.dfsg</replaceable>
  &gitcmd; checkout <replaceable>master</replaceable>
  &gitcmd; pull <replaceable>.</replaceable> <replaceable>dfsg_clean</replaceable>
</programlisting>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="gbp.special.nmus">
    <title>Importing NMUs</title>
    <para>
    First, create a branch that holds the NMUs from the tip of your
    <option>debian-branch</option> (default is <emphasis>master</emphasis>) once:
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; <option>branch</option> <replaceable>nmu</replaceable> <replaceable>master</replaceable>
</programlisting>
    <para>
    To import an NMU, change into the git repository and use &gbp-import-dsc;:
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; checkout <replaceable>master</replaceable>
  &gbp-import-dsc; <option>--debian-branch</option>=<replaceable>nmu</replaceable> <filename>/path/to/package_1.0-1nmu0.dsc</filename>
</programlisting>
    <para>
    This will import the NMU onto the branched named <emphasis>nmu</emphasis>
    instead of the default <option>master</option>. This method can also
    be used to import "old" releases into the &git; repository when migrating
    to &git; from another VCS.
    </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="gbp.special.pbuilder">
    <title>Building with &cowbuilder;</title>
    <para>
      &cowbuilder; is nice tool to build Debian packages in a defined
      environment.  It makes sure all build-dependencies are specified
      correctly by building the package in a clean chroot. As its
      cousin &pbuilder; it can be extended via hooks to (e.g. run
      autopkg tests) but doesn't need a tarball unpacked but uses copy
      on write tree to speed up the build.
    </para>

    <para>
      Since &cowbuilder; uses different command line arguments than
      &debuild; and &dpkg-buildpackage;, we can't simply pass the
      options to run it on the command line. To simplifiy the
      integration we use a separate helper named &git-pbuilder;.
      &gbp; has it's own command line option for this:
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gbp-buildpackage; <option>--git-pbuilder</option>
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This will set the build command to run &git-pbuilder; (which
      invokes &cowbuilder; by default) and the clean command
      to <command>/bin/true</command>. It also activates the parsing
      of several &git-pbuilder; related options
      like <option>--git-dist</option>, <option>--git-arch</option> and
      <option>--git-pbuilder-options</option>.
    </para>

    <para>
      We can make &git-pbuilder; usage the default by adding it to
      <filename>~/.gbp.conf</filename>:
    </para>
<programlisting>
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; <filename>~/.gbp.conf</filename>
[DEFAULT]
# We invoke cowbuilder via git-pbuilder. Arguments passed to &gbp-buildpackage;
# will be passed to dpkg-buildpackage in the chroot
pbuilder = True
EOF
</programlisting>
      <para>
	<command>git-pbuilder</command> defaults to building a package for the
	<envar>sid</envar> distribution. If you want to build for another
	distribution, pass this in the <option>--git-dist</option> option:

<programlisting>
  &gbp-buildpackage; --git-pbuilder --git-dist=jessie
</programlisting>

	If you want to use <command>debuild</command> again (without
	modifying <filename>~/.gbp.conf</filename>), you can use:
      </para>
<programlisting>
  &gbp-buildpackage; --git-no-pbuilder
</programlisting>
      <para>
	In order for all of the above to work you have to create a
	base chroot first using &git-pbuilder;:
      </para>
<programlisting>
  <command>git-pbuilder</command> create
</programlisting>
      <para>
	This can later be updated using:
      </para>
<programlisting>
  <command>git-pbuilder</command> update
</programlisting>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="gbp.special.hacking">
    <title>Working on random packages</title>
    <para>
    Whenever you need to work on an arbitrary &debian; package, you can check it
    right into &git; with one command:
<programlisting>
  &gbp-import-dsc apt:<filename>package</filename>
  cd <filename>package</filename>
  &gitcmd; branch debian
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    This uses <command>apt-get</command> to download the source package,
    puts the orig tarball on the <option>upstream-branch</option> and the
    &debian; changes on the <option>debian-branch</option> (by default
    <emphasis>master</emphasis>). The second command
    creates a branch called <emphasis>debian</emphasis>. Now you can easily
    modify the package, revert changes you made, create other branches for
    testing, see what changes you made, etc.  When finished, just do</para>
<programlisting>
  &gitcmd; commit -a
  &gitcmd; diff debian --
</programlisting>
    <para>
    to get a nice patch that can be submitted to the &debian; BTS. You can also
    fetch the source package from a URL:

<programlisting>
  &gbp-import-dsc <filename>http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/i/ipsec-tools/ipsec-tools_0.7.3-9.dsc</filename>
</programlisting>

   The import works incrementally; you can import new versions on top of
   already imported ones for e.g. easy review of changes.
    </para>

    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="gbp.special.sloppytarball">
    <title>Sloppy tarball creation</title>
    <para>
      By default &gbp-buildpackage; uses <filename>debian/changelog</filename> to detect
      the upstream version and build the corrsponding tarball either via &pristine-tar; or
      by using <command>git archive</command> directly. This ensures that the tarball matches
      what's in the Debian archive already.
    </para>
    <para>
      But there might be cases where you don't want to follow these
      packaging practice and create a fresh <emphasis>dirty</emphasis>
      tarball that contains additional changes. Such tarballs are not
      suitable for upload into the archive but might be helpful in local testing.
    </para>
    <para>
      Especially when getting started and when you first want to get a
      package built and dive into &gbp-dch;, &git-pbuilder; and the 3.0
      (quilt) format later to find out what exactly
<programlisting>
dpkg-source: info: local changes detected, the modified files are:
 hello-debhelper/configure
dpkg-source: error: aborting due to unexpected upstream changes, see /tmp/hello-debhelper_2.8-1.diff.har2Xx
dpkg-source: info: you can integrate the local changes with dpkg-source --commit
</programlisting>
means.
    </para>
    <para>
      For that you can force &gbp-buildpackage; to create a tarball
      from the <emphasis>debian-branch</emphasis> dropping
      the <filename>debian/</filename> directory. This will give you a
      tarball that is very close to your current working copy except
      for the packaging.
    </para>
<programlisting>
  &gbp-buildpackage --git-ignore-new --git-force-create --git-upstream-tree=SLOPPY --git-no-pristine-tar
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The important part is the <emphasis>SLOPPY</emphasis> above. The
      other options are there to prevent &gbp-buildpackage; from using
      &pristine-tar;, to force the creation of a new tarball and to
      not abort if you have changes in your current working copy.

      If you're still getting an error about <emphasis>unexpected
      upstream changes</emphasis> make sure you have no uncomitted
      changes in you workig copy (changes in
      the <filename>debian/</filename> are o.k.) and no files that are
      ignored by git
      via <filename>.gitignore</filename>. A <command>git clean
      -dfx</command> can help here.
    </para>
    <para>
      Please don't use this tarball to upload to the Debian archive
      since changes outside <filename>debian/</filename> need to be
      represented by patches in <filename>debian/patches</filename>.
      See the <command>dpkg-source</command> manpage for
      details.
