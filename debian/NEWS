git-buildpackage (0.8.14) experimental; urgency=medium

  gbp import-orig's --merge-mode option now defaults to 'auto' selecting
  'replace' for 3.0 (quilt) packages and 'merge' otherwise. If you want to
  retain the old behaviour of 'merge' please do so in gbp.conf.

git-buildpackage (0.6.26) unstable; urgency=medium

  All gbp-* and git-* commands are now gone as announced in the
  deprecation notice from June 2013. From now on only "gbp <command>" is
  supported.

git-buildpackage (0.6.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version changes the default of the cleaner options from 'debuild clean'
  to a noop ('/bin/true'). If you want to retain the old behaviour you can still
  configure it via gbp.conf. For more details see #670624.

git-buildpackage (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to provide a more consistent and git like interface a new gbp super
  command was added as a front end to all git-* and gbp-* commands. So what was
  either git-<command> or gbp-<command> is now

      gbp <command>

  The old commands are still provided for backward compatibility but will be
  removed in a future release so please update any scripts and tools relying on
  it.

git-buildpackage (0.4.61) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to not override dpkg-buildpackage's defaults for 3.0 source packages
  the default builder command is now "debuild -i -I" instead of "debuild
  -i\.git/ -I.git". If you want to retain the old behaviour please adjust your
  gbp.conf accordingly.

git-buildpackage (0.4.57) unstable; urgency=low

  git-import-orig doesn't generate changelog entries by default anymore. This
  means you can safely remove --no-dch from all your scripts and config files.

  If you want git-import-orig to behave as before add:
     postimport = dch -v%(version)s New Upstream Version
  to your gbp.conf. If you want to invoke git-dch instead, you can use:
     postimport = git-dch -N%(version)s -S -a
  The later is recommended since it creates git-dch compatible changelog
  entries.

git-buildpackage (0.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this version git-buildpackage doesn't pass hardcoded '-i\.git -I.git'
  to the build command specified via --git-builder (or via the builder config
  file options). So if you're not using the default build command (which is
  now 'debuild -i\.git -I.git' instead of just plain 'debuild') you'll have to
  add these options to your build command in order to exclude git metadata
  from your diffs and source tarballs.
  This was done to make the invocation of the build command more flexible, we
  don't rely on debuild behaviour from now on.
  Again: if you didn't change the default build command, you don't have to
  change anything.

git-buildpackage (0.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  Generated tags are now by default put into debian/ and upstream/ namespaces.
  This doesn't have any effect on already existing tags.
