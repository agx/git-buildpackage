  * [f76f200] clone: Allow to automatically add upstream vcs.
    While "gbp import-orig" supports "--upstream-vcs" since some time to
    link to the upstream git history however setup of the upstream remote
    repo so far was manual.
    To make this more automatic add "--add-upstream-vcs" to "gbp clone"
    (defaulting to False) and set up the upstreamvcs remote in case there's
    sufficient information in debian/upstream/metadata. Once added fetch
    from that remote initially.
  * [37cd681] git-pbuilder: export GBP_{DIST,ARCH,BUILDER} to the environment.
    This makes sure we don't export very generic vars while still being able
    to make decisions based on what was passed to gbp.
  * [2f463b9] config: Print correct default for postunpack hook
  * [5155e98] Build-depend on python3-filelock.

  * [907e17a] rpm: Fix flake8

  [ Stefano Rivera ]
  * [ccbb64b] Specify a sysconfig scheme in smoke-rpm.
    Debian uses the posix_local scheme by default, since Python 3.10,
    causing the rpm to be built with the incorrect layout.
  * [3954043] Explicitly use the deb install layout when building our RPM.
    Debian defaults to installing to /usr/local, unless told otherwise. This
    is usually done by passing --install-layout=deb to setup.py, when called
    directly. But that's only an option on Debian systems that have this
    patch. Set the environment variable equivalent, instead.

  * [231ecef] import-orig: Don’t hardcode the pristine-tar branch

  * [bb783b5] HACKING: Document how to keep test repos around
  * [63ce4ed] tests: Fix "test_push_failure" with newer git.
    The test created a broken tag on the remote side to avoid that being
    pushed in the test however git 2.34 and newer fail every push to that
    repo so rather create a non-ff branch instead to make the push fail.
  * [caf64cb] push: Make --debian-tag='' match the documentation.
    An empty Debian tag indicates "don't care" about the packaging branch.
    Don't fail in that case but rather push out up to the branch tip.
    this makes it simpler to push the current development work via
      gbp  push --debian-tag='' <remote>

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * [5dcd753] docs: port build system to newer pydoctor.
    According to https://pydoctor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help.html, the
    command line and configuration parsing has changed in an incompatible
    way. These changes fix the documentation build for me, but are probably
    backwards-incompatible with older versions of pydoctor.
  * [0dfc259] tests: set HOME to an unexisting directory.
    The test suite contains several assumptions about the global git
    configuration, including but not limited to the default branch name
    being `master`. By running the tests against a unexisting HOME, git will
    not load the user configuration and instead use all the git defaults.

  [ Andrej Shadura ]
  * [434d558] import-dsc: Delete NULs from dpkg-parsechangelog output before
    parsing. Commit messages may not contain NUL characters; in practice,
    Debian changelogs sometimes do, usually as the result of incorrectly used
    encoding for non-ASCII personal names.  As a safety net, delete all NULs
    from the output of dpkg-parsechangelog before parsing it, so that they
    don’t get fed into Git or anything else further in the processing.
    (Closes: #981340)
  * [0d21789] clone: Don’t check out the Debian branch if it doesn’t exist
  * [b17c14a] gbp.git: Change list_tree to return an iterator.
    When working with huge trees, we want to avoid consuming large amounts
    of memory just to throw away most of it almost immediately when we only
    need one entry or a few of them.
  * [3fa9f4d] gbp.git: Add support for long listing format (with object sizes)
    This is useful to be able to scan a tree for a specific file
    but only act if it’s non-empty.
  * [8e0e7cc] repo_setup: Add check/setup_gitattributes
    setup_gitattributes() sets up .git/info/attributes in a way to prevent
    transformations from interfering with packaging, because the working tree
    files can differ from the Git revision history (and from the source
    packages).
    Similar functionality has been implemented by dgit and git-deborig, so we
    try to stay compatible and re-use the name of the attribute macro. Since
    dgit doesn’t disable export-subst and export-ignore, which may interfere
    with export-orig, we add this on top the same way git-deborig does.
    dgit used to have an older preset missing some of the attributes, so if
    we find those, we disable them.
    The user, should they choose so, still can re-enable the attributes
    disabled in this way by adding more specific rules further in the
    .git/info/attributes file.
  * [20052e1] clone: Add --defuse-gitattributes.
    On clone, disable Git attributes that may interfere with building
    packages shipping .gitattributes *iff* they ship those files.
    Set to auto by default, can also be turned off completely or
    can be performed unconditionally.
  * [7a9079a] scripts: Add setup-gitattributes subcommand.
    The setup-gitattributes subcommands overrides Git attributes
    unconditionally, without verifying first the package ships any
    .gitattributes files.
  * [660c027] docs: gbp-clone: Document --defuse-gitattributes.

    With post-unpack scripts is currently possible to filter out files that

    to filter files that will end up in the orig file, and in some scenarios
    this is not easily doable just using a filter list.

  * [e74b40a] rpm: conditionally check for librpm flags.  Not all of them are
    in newer librpm and this way we can add new ones as needed as well.
    This unbreaks the tests with new python3-rpm in sid.
  * [c429d97] dch: make --auto the default.  The current default mode of

  * [5b1614d] travis: run tests under C locale too
  * [79d4340] setup.py: add python_requires so pip doesn't use the gbp module

    Thanks to Nico Schlömer for the proposed solution
  * [d656cbd] import-dsc: Fuzzy parse changelog date.
    Especially older changelogs aren't 100% policy conformant (e.g. using a
    localized day of week like).  This allows us to better import older
    histories. (Closes: #880878)
  * [577ca32] import-orig: Run postimport hook on all successful imports.
    So far we would skip it on initial imports which is pointless.
  * [7d6f61a] import-orig: don't fail when importing unpacked dirs.
  * [34b2390] import-orig: avoid master branch when importing into empty repo.
    We don't want a master branch if debian-branch != 'master'.
  * [c135ad4] Make import-orig-rpm tests work with import-orig.
    We use the Debian version to import RPMs since there's currently no
    separate import-orig-rpm needed.  The tests also cover cases we were
    currently not testing in components/deb/test_import_orig.py.
  * [fe0022b] import-dsc: cleanup temp dirs on unexpected exceptions too
  * [486cbfd] examples: drop gbp-posttag-push.  We have "gbp push" now.

    This way we only get the debian- and upstream-branch in empty repos and
    not a pointless 'master' if debian-branch != master.
    It also makes sure we don't need --create-missing-branches on empty

  * [4b9789a] import-dsc: Look for pristine-tar reference by commit.  The

    sure things don't get wired if we move code around.
  * [d0ee56b] import-dsc: don't create pristine-tar commits on every import.
    We must not create pristine-tar commits if no new upstream sources were

  * [0c6cbfa] bash completion: don't accidentally match subcommands as options.

  * [7a503e9] pq: move switch_pq() to common.
  * [cb9271f] GitRepository: add diff_status method.

    For selecting whether to dump all the files recursively or just the top

  * [ff4cc8b] config: read the right config if run from subdir.
    A step towards being able to run GBP tools from subdirectories.
    Now expands '%(top_dir)s' and '%(git_dir)s' in config file path to root
    of the working directory and git metadata directory, respectively.
    Also, adds a new method _read_config_file() in preparation for

    Fixes tests.test_Config: currently the only correct way to define the

    variable.
  * [60479af] Introduce gbp-pq-rpm.
    Initial version of gbp-pq-rpm - a tool for managing patch queues for rpm
    packages. The functionality more or less corresponds to that of the
    (Debian) gbp-pq. The only major difference probably being (in addition
    to the obvious of working with .spec files instead of debian/) is that
    patches are always imported on top of the upstream version, not on top
    of the packaging branch (which might not even contain any source code).

    format directly, without the need for the error-prone "format-patch,
    parse patch files, mangle and re-write patch files" cycle.
    Also, fix patch naming in patch generation when '--no-patch-numbers' is
    used.  Previously, multiple commits with the same subject resulted in
    multiple patches having the same filename. This lead into broken series
    with missing patches as patch files were overwritten by the topmost
    commit.
  * [017fac3] pq.format_patch: support file path filtering.
    Implements a filter option that allows filtering out changes to certain
    files/paths in the patch-generation. A commit is totally ignored if all
    files would be filtered out. The path filter is given as a Python
    regexp.
  * [a0d6eb7] pq: properly generate non-ascii patch files.
    Encode non-ascii email headers properly. Also, set MIME headers
    correctly for the message body if the commit message body contains
    non-ascii characters.
    The reason for constructing the message in a little bit "clumsy" way is
    the intention is to match the output of git-format-patch as closely as
    possible.
  * [91fbdc1] pq: support patch-export commands.
    Support giving commands to pq as a meta tag in commit message. The
    format is "Gbp: <command> [args]".
    Currently, only one command is supported. namely 'ignore'. That is, one
    can use 'Gbp: Ignore' in the commit message for ignoring the commit in

  * [60ffe95] --git-hooks doesn't take an argument
  * [7a29e42] Move MockedChangelog to testutils and allow to specify the
    content so we can reuse it for other dch tests.
  * [938e4cd] dch: make automatic adding of new sections more robust.
    The code that determined if we found a snapshot header was obfuscated by
    the code that determines the commits to add. Split those and better
    document their purpose. Also always return the commit to start from so we
    don't need to repeat the logic in the upper levels.
  * [d0fb6d8] Minor docstring updates
  * [388cfb8] docs: Add recommended branch layout.
    It'd be nice to have similar branch layouts among packages so recommend
    one that worked well so far.
  * [34b2079] GitRepository: allow to use '..' instead of '...'
    The symmetric difference isn't always useful since it includes changes
    from both branches. See #680705.
  * [f793ed0] pq: exclude patches from Debian packaging branch.
    When regenerating the patch queue including patches from the Debian
    branch is not useful. Addresses parts of #680705.
    Thanks to Benjamin Cama for the detailed analysis.
  * [283c847] docs: Refert to gbp in the introduction since this wraps all
    commands now.
    Thanks to Ross Boylan for pointing out that the current wording is
    confusing.

  * Introduce gbp supercommand to get rid of the git-<command> vs.
    gbp-<command> inconsistencies:
      * [12dce5f] Add wrapper for all gbp commands.  So like git you can now
        use gbp <command> instead of git-<command> or gbp-<command>. The
        manpages and docs aren't adjusted yet.

      * [b47b7e8] Update package description
      * [fe9f925] GbpOptionParser: Make sure we parse the old config sections.
        For backward compatibility between {gbp,git}-<command> and "gbp
        <command>" make sure we parse the former sections if using the later.
      * [375014d] gbp: support --help
      * [a5aff11] Consistently call gbp the supercommand and robustify against
        invalid modules names.
      * [e09ef94] gbp-import-dscs: invoke gbp import-dsc instead of
        git-import-dsc
      * [38d43b4] config: Don't fill in the parser with all defaults.
  * [4d6eecb] GitRepository.get_subject: use get_commit_info.
    This kills another _git_getoutput. Also deprecate the method since we
    don't need to special case the subject.
  * [caff99c] GbpOptionParser: Make sure we access the GbpOptionParser*'s
    default dict and not the one from the OptionParser. The instance's default
    dict this gets reset to empty when invoking OptionParser.__init__.
  * [1158503] GbpOptionParser: add test for 'filter' option handling
  * [ed63276] Git-Ignore generated gbp.conf.5 too
  * [3966076] Remove unused imports
  * [b59818d] import-dsc: print filename instead of object name

  [ Markus Lehtonen ]
  * [fa414e5] gitmodifier: make the datetime object always have timezone.  To
    be consistent with the date property and for easier compatibility with git
    dates.
  * [f717975] GitRepository/get_commit_info: add patchname to info.
    Add a new 'patchname' field to the information returned by
    get_commit_info. That is, the subject in a sanitized format, similar to
    what git-format-patch uses.
  * [74d956f] import-orig: keep working copy in sync with branch HEAD.
    Update working copy and index (to branch HEAD) if we modify the
    currently checked-out branch. Otherwise the repository is left in
    unclean state when the current branch is upstream or pristine-tar and
    the '--no-merge' option is used.
  * [a30f9e7] buildpackage: use get_commit_info() instead of get_subject()
    Utilize the get_commit_info() method of GitRepository instead of the
    deprecated get_subject().
  * [75cbd9a] GitRepository/diff: allow single object.
    Allow diffing a single object, e.g. getting diff from single commit.

  [ Thomas Koch ]
  * [3d6b68a] tests: Use tempfile.mkdtemp to create temp dirs for tests.
    This puts test dirs below /tmp which often is a tmpfs.
    All tests include the context module which consolidates tmpdir creation
    and cleanup, undoes a chdir in teardown and silences log messages.

    WITHOUT_NOSETESTS environment variable when running setup.
  * [3d80b2f] GitRepository/_cmd_has_feature: more intelligent parsing.
    More intelligent parsing of the git output (man page). Try to
    parse optional options like '--[no-]standard-notes' of git-show
    correctly. In this example both 'no-standard-notes' and 'standard-notes'
    would be available.
  * [57bbd0a] GitArgs: utilize the add() method in other add_X methods.
    Only use the add() method for updating the argument list. This makes the

  [ Markus Lehtonen ]
  * [83c2c3f] log: rewrite the module to use Python logging module.  Replaces
    the Logger with a new one, derived from the Logger class of the Python
    standard library. Colorized output is handled by a separate handler class.
  * [48c48c9] log: add support for setting the color scheme.  Implements
    changeable color schemes in the gbp.log module. Color scheme is given as a
    colon-separated list, with one color for each log level:
    '<debug_color>:<info_color>:<warning_colro>:<error_color>'. Colors can be
    given as an integer number (ANSI terminal color code) or color name (.e.g
    'red').  Missing or empty fields are interpreted as using the default color
    for that log level.
  * [ebbe635] New configuration option for setting the output color scheme.
    Adds a new command line and config file option 'color-scheme' for
    selecting the colors used in log output.
  * [ec2b74c] GitRepository/strip_sha1: fix length checking.
    Accept longer sha1 than what was asked for. The length option given to
    git is merely a "wish to get a sha1 of this length". Git may also return
    longer sha1 if truncating to given length would give
    ambiguous/non-unique sha1.
  * [c9011f7] Tristate: allow to init from another Tristate object
  * [4b719cd] Tristate: drop broken and unused is_valid_state() method
  * [4bdfe2a] log: make color setting a tristate on/off/auto.
    Makes it possible to force color=on e.g. when piping output. Also, moves
    all 'auto' logic to one single place, i.e. the streamhandler.
  * [ab7a732] pq: do author guessing outside the apply_patch functions.
    Call the author parsing/guessing function outside the apply patch
    functions. This way, the caller can decide when to do the guessing, and
    with which parameters. Now the apply_patch functions do what their name
    suggests.

    This change makes is_link_target() re-usable in the upcoming RPM-tools.
  * [36e0986] common/pq: use strip in apply_and_commit_patch()
    Use the strip information of the patch when applying patches. Also,
    changes GitRepository.apply_patch() to accept integer values as 'strip'
    argument.
  * [cc1ebfd] PristineTar: move Debian-specific stuff to DebianPristineTar.
    Continuation to the PristineTar refactoring, makes the "common"
    PristineTar independent of DebianPkgPolicy. This commit moves the
    Debian-specific has_commit() and checkout() methods to DebianPristineTar
    class and replaces them with more generic functions in the base class.
    Also, drops the Debian-specific get_commit() method completely, as it
    was not used outside the PristineTar class itself.
  * [18fc698] GitRepository: fix process cwd in _git_inout()
  * [1e85978] GitRepository: make get_commit_info() more robust.
    Now uses git-show instead of git-log. This is needed for further
    enhancements (namely to get name-status for merge commits). Also, use
    null-character as the field separator which makes parsing more reliable.
    The method now returns 'body' of the commit message as is, without
    stripping or splitting to lines.
    In addition, get_commit_info() now uses GitArgs and _git_inout() instead
    of the deprecated _git_getoutput().
  * [2c668bf] GitRepository/get_commit_info: check return value of git command
    correctly
  * [4d56ab6] GitRepository/rev_parse: add new argument 'short'

  * [21ac2d8] GitRepository: option to ignore untracked in is_clean()
    Add an option to ignore untracked files when checking if the repository

  * git-pbuilder: add filter for git meta data and allow to pass options to
    pbuilder vi $PBUILDER_OPTS (Closes: #439535)

      * importing of an empty .diff.gz (like libx86 0.99-1.2)
  * doc: remove stray ';' from special.sgml. Thanks to Loïc Minier
  * doc: gbp.conf is per working copy, not per repository

git-buildpackage (0.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * posttag support for git-buildpackage: use --git-posttag to run a command
    after a successfull build and tag (e.g. --git-posttag='git-push --tags
    git.alioth.org')
  * repositories that weren't created by git-import-dsc and never had the
    upstream sources as a single commit (let alone an upstream branch) can be
    made git-import-orig compatible by using git's grafts - mention this in
    the manual. This (Closes: #403988) since with this every git repo can use
    git-import-orig (with some preparation).
  * Allow to specify the tag format. The format of generated tags can now be
    specified via the debian-tag and upsteam-tag options. The default now puts
    debian tags and upstream tags into different namespaces (Closes: #408990).
