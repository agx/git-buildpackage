  * [b6a94b6] git-pbuilder: Run actions under "set -x"
    cowbuilder is currently very terse about certain errors so run the
    action under "set -x" to print the exact command invocation.
    This will also help to diagnose sudo issues.
  * [ef1d8e7] create-remote-repo: allow to list config sections via
      gbp create-remote-repo list
  * [be44031] gbp create-remote-repo: autocomplete --remote-config= too
  * [1291b17] Update to git-builder 1.43. Thanks Russ Allberry!

    from https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers
  * [9cbb9df] Use relative patch to install gbp.conf to make
    pip install --user work
  * [6f5070d] bash completion: don't complete options values with options.  So
    far hitting <tab> on --bar= would have all other options as suggestions
    which is confusing.
  * [a21e394] bash completion: complete tags on --upstream-vcs-tag= too
  * [fe39b8e] bash completion: complete filenames on hooks, cleaners and builders

    existing ones.

    --repo-{user,email} options

  * [e31f15b] gbp pq: Don't fail --commit on empty commits. So far we would fail
    empty commits with a confusing error
  * [bad1f23] import-orig: Handle download errors properly.
  * [d90e6be] import-orig: determine download automatically making --download
    superfluous and deprecated.
  * [58271d6] import-dsc: determine download automatically making --download
    superfluous and deprecated.
  * [8038a6f] import-dsc: Improve error message if there is no dsc file
    instead of spewing the exception on the console.
  * [9ecb5a4] Add helper to run tests in docker container
    and use this on travisci. Some ideas taken form travis.debian.net.
  * [3b1b9bc] GitRepository: use GitArgs for update_ref
  * [1ac2724] GitRepository.commit_dir: add a proper reflog entry
    otherwise 'gbp import-dsc' adds reflog entries without a description.
  * [7ae2778] GitRepository: allow for dry-run push
  * Various enhancements to the test-suite including tests that reach out to
    the network to test these import options
  * Various enhancements to the gbp-posttag-push example hook like trying the
    git push with --dry-run before the upload.

    the command doesn't even get to print to stderr (i.e. missing on disk).

    A step towards being able to run GBP tools from subdirectories.
    Now expands '%(top_dir)s' and '%(git_dir)s' in config file path to root
    of the working directory and git metadata directory, respectively.

    Initial version of gbp-pq-rpm - a tool for managing patch queues for rpm

    to the obvious of working with .spec files instead of debian/) is that

  * [3e09958] Disable html coverage generation until python-nose is fixed.

  [ Markus Lehtonen ]
  * [c661c71] pq: rewrite patch export functionality.
    Use our own function for constructing the patch files instead of using
    the format-patch command of git. This way, we get the desired output
    format directly, without the need for the error-prone "format-patch,
    parse patch files, mangle and re-write patch files" cycle.
    Also, fix patch naming in patch generation when '--no-patch-numbers' is
    used.  Previously, multiple commits with the same subject resulted in
    multiple patches having the same filename. This lead into broken series
    with missing patches as patch files were overwritten by the topmost
    commit.
  * [017fac3] pq.format_patch: support file path filtering.
    Implements a filter option that allows filtering out changes to certain
    files/paths in the patch-generation. A commit is totally ignored if all
    files would be filtered out. The path filter is given as a Python
    regexp.
  * [a0d6eb7] pq: properly generate non-ascii patch files.
    Encode non-ascii email headers properly. Also, set MIME headers
    correctly for the message body if the commit message body contains
    non-ascii characters.
    The reason for constructing the message in a little bit "clumsy" way is
    the intention is to match the output of git-format-patch as closely as
    possible.
  * [91fbdc1] pq: support patch-export commands.
    Support giving commands to pq as a meta tag in commit message. The
    format is "Gbp: <command> [args]".
    Currently, only one command is supported. namely 'ignore'. That is, one
    can use 'Gbp: Ignore' in the commit message for ignoring the commit in
    patch-generation.
  * [3dccca6] pq: add format_diff() function.
    For generating a patch file from a diff between two arbitrary commits.
  * [34e85f7] pq: listen to 'Gbp-Pq:' commands, too

  * [83c2c3f] log: rewrite the module to use Python logging module.  Replaces
    the Logger with a new one, derived from the Logger class of the Python
    standard library. Colorized output is handled by a separate handler class.
  * [48c48c9] log: add support for setting the color scheme.  Implements
    changeable color schemes in the gbp.log module. Color scheme is given as a
    colon-separated list, with one color for each log level:
    '<debug_color>:<info_color>:<warning_colro>:<error_color>'. Colors can be
    given as an integer number (ANSI terminal color code) or color name (.e.g
    'red').  Missing or empty fields are interpreted as using the default color
    for that log level.
  * [ebbe635] New configuration option for setting the output color scheme.
    Adds a new command line and config file option 'color-scheme' for
    selecting the colors used in log output.
  * [ec2b74c] GitRepository/strip_sha1: fix length checking.
    Accept longer sha1 than what was asked for. The length option given to
    git is merely a "wish to get a sha1 of this length". Git may also return
    longer sha1 if truncating to given length would give
    ambiguous/non-unique sha1.
  * [c9011f7] Tristate: allow to init from another Tristate object
  * [4b719cd] Tristate: drop broken and unused is_valid_state() method
  * [4bdfe2a] log: make color setting a tristate on/off/auto.
    Makes it possible to force color=on e.g. when piping output. Also, moves
    all 'auto' logic to one single place, i.e. the streamhandler.
  * [ab7a732] pq: do author guessing outside the apply_patch functions.
    Call the author parsing/guessing function outside the apply patch
    functions. This way, the caller can decide when to do the guessing, and
    with which parameters. Now the apply_patch functions do what their name
    suggests.
  * [9c80f14] buildpackage: add 'force' option to write_wc()
    To select whether to include file that would otherwise be ignored by
    gitignore (.gitignore or .git/info/exclude).
  * [5e6f163] tests.testutils: baseclass for testing commandline tools.
    Introduce a new baseclass to be utilized in testing the git-buildpackage
    command line tools.

    argument.
  * [cc1ebfd] PristineTar: move Debian-specific stuff to DebianPristineTar.
    Continuation to the PristineTar refactoring, makes the "common"
    PristineTar independent of DebianPkgPolicy. This commit moves the
    Debian-specific has_commit() and checkout() methods to DebianPristineTar
    class and replaces them with more generic functions in the base class.

  * [18fc698] GitRepository: fix process cwd in _git_inout()

    Now uses git-show instead of git-log. This is needed for further
    enhancements (namely to get name-status for merge commits). Also, use
    null-character as the field separator which makes parsing more reliable.
    The method now returns 'body' of the commit message as is, without
    stripping or splitting to lines.

    of the deprecated _git_getoutput().

  * git-buildpackage now supports signed tags via the "sign-tag" and "keyid"

    on how this ensured.
