# Wrapper around pbuilder for gbp buildpackage
#
# Note that this script requires bash, not a POSIX shell, because it uses bash
# arrays to handle GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS and GIT_PBUILDER_PDEBUILDOPTIONS.
# It's otherwise quite difficult to get the contents of that environment

=head1 NAME

git-pbuilder - Wrapper around cowbuilder/qemubuilder for gbp buildpackage

=head1 SYNOPSIS

DIST=I<distribution> ARCH=I<architecture> [BUILDER=(pbuilder|qemubuilder)] \
    B<git-pbuilder> I<debbuild-options>

DIST=I<distribution> ARCH=I<architecture> [BUILDER=(pbuilder|qemubuilder)] \
    B<git-pbuilder> (update | create | login) I<cowbuilder-options>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<git-pbuilder> is a wrapper around B<pdebuild> intended for use by
B<gbp buildpackage>.  It configures B<pdebuild> to use B<cowbuilder> by
default, passes appropriate options to B<debbuild>, and sets the base path
for B<cowbuilder> based on the environment variable DIST and, if set, the
environment variable ARCH.  B<qemubuilder> can be selected instead by
setting the environment variable BUILDER to C<qemubuilder>, and
B<pbuilder> can be selected by setting BUILDER to C<pbuilder>.

By default, B<git-pbuilder> assumes the target distribution is C<sid>, the
same architecture as the B<cowbuilder> default, and uses
F</var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.cow> if it exists.  If it doesn't,
F</var/cache/pbuilder/base.cow> is tried.  If DIST is set, its value is
the target distribution and F</var/cache/pbuilder/base-I<dist>.cow> is
used instead.  If DIST is C<etch> or C<ebo>, B<--debian-etch-workaround>
is also passed to B<cowbuilder>.  If ARCH is set, its value is the target
architecture and F</var/cache/pbuilder/base-I<dist>-I<arch>.cow> is used,
with I<dist> being set to C<sid> if DIST was not set.

If B<qemubuilder> is used as the builder, no base directory is used.
Instead, B<qemubuilder> is invoked with the B<--config> option pointing to
the file F</var/cache/pbuilder/qemubuilder-I<arch>-I<dist>.conf>

If B<pbuilder> is used as the builder, B<git-pbuilder> instead looks for
F</var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.tgz> by default and
F</var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz> if it doesn't exist.  If DIST or ARCH are
set, they are used to form the expected name of the tgz file in the same
way as they're used to form the expected base directory for B<cowbuilder>.
Similar to B<cowbuilder>, B<--debian-etch-workaround> is passed to
B<pbuilder> if from the DIST setting it looks like the target distribution
is etch.

If B<git-pbuilder> is invoked via a name that starts with C<git-*->, the
part between the hyphens is taken to be the default name of the builder to
use.  However, C<pbuilder> is mapped to B<cowbuilder> for backward
compatibility; if you want to use B<pbuilder>, you have to explicitly set
BUILDER.  The part after the last hyphen is taken to be the default
distribution (if it contains no additional hyphen) or the default
distribution followed by the default architecture (if it contains a
hyphen).  One can therefore create symlinks like C<git-pbuilder-squeeze>
pointing to B<git-pbuilder> and use that name when wanting to use a
distribution of C<squeeze>, or C<git-qemubuilder-sid-armel> to use
B<qemubuilder> to build for the C<armel> architecture and the C<sid>
distribution.  Explicit settings of BUILDER, DIST, or ARCH always override
any guesses from the command name.  (But note that B<gbp buildpackage>
does not pass on environment variables when run with B<--git-pbuilder>;
see below.)

Any arguments are passed as-is to B<dpkg-buildpackage> via the
B<--debbuildopts> option to B<pdebuild>.  To pass arguments to the builder
instead, put them in the environment variable GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS.

To disable all attempts to discover the base path, tarball, or
configuration file and set up the pbuilder options and instead rely on the
settings in .pbuilderrc, set GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF to C<no>.

Normally, one does not run this script directly.  Instead, it's used as
the builder script for B<gbp buildpackage> via the B<--git-pbuilder>
command-line option.  When run this way, you should use the B<--git-dist>,
B<--git-arch>, B<--git-qemubuilder>, B<--git-pbuilder-autoconf>, and
B<--git-pbuilder-options> flags instead of setting the DIST, ARCH, BUILDER,
GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF, and GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS environment variables.  See
L<gbp-buildpackage(1)> for more information.

Alternately, B<git-pbuilder> may be called with an argument of C<update>,
C<create>, or C<login>.  In this case, it calls B<cowbuilder> (or the
configured builder as described above) using B<sudo> and passes the
corresponding command to the builder, using the same logic as above to
determine the base directory and distribution.  If the distribution (set
in DIST) ends in C<-backports>, one of the following will be added as an
B<--othermirror> parameter to the builder:

    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian $DIST main
    deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports $DIST main

The first will be used for most distributions, and the second for
C<squeeze-backports>. If the distribution ends in C<-lts>, the following will
be added as an B<--othermirror> parameter to the builder:

    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian $DIST main

to support building for Long Term Support releases.

Any additional arguments to B<git-pbuilder> are passed along to the
builder.  Due to how B<sudo> works, invoking the builder with an action
will not read the user's F<.pbuilderrc> by default, so in this case
B<git-pbuilder> will add an explicit B<--configfile> option pointing to
the user's F<.pbuilderrc> if it exists.

If you use B<git-pbuilder> with one of these arguments, you must have
the C<sudo> package installed, and you must configure B<sudo> to let the
current user run the appropriate builder command.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item ARCH

Sets the target architecture.  For a B<cowbuilder> builder, this sets both
the base path and is passed as the B<--architecture> option.  With
B<qemubuilder>, this controls the path to the configuration file.  With
B<pbuilder>, this sets the tgz path and is passed as B<--architecture>.

=item BUILDER

Sets the builder to use.  The only supported settings are C<cowbuilder>
(the default), C<qemubuilder>, and C<pbuilder>.

=item COWBUILDER_BASE

Set this environment variable to change the default location for the
cowbuilder base directories (F</var/cache/pbuilder>).

=item DIST

Sets the target distribution.  This is used primarily to determine the
base path for B<cowbuilder> or B<pbuilder> or the configuration file path
for B<qemubuilder>, but it's also used to determine whether to pass
B<--debian-etch-workaround> to B<cowbuilder> or B<pbuilder>.

=item GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF

If set to C<no>, disable the logic that constructs the base path, tarball,
or configuration file and all other logic to determine the options to pass
to the builder.  Instead, just run the configured builder and assume its
configuration is handled elsewhere (such as in F<.pbuilderrc>).  This also
suppresses setting B<--buildresult>, so the user will need to ensure that
the configuration still puts packages where B<gbp buildpackage> expects
them.

=item GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS

Add additional options for the builder.  These options are passed as-is to
B<cowbuilder>, B<qemubuilder>, or B<pbuilder> via B<pdebuild>.  The
contents of this variable will undergo shell expansion, so any arguments
containing shell metacharacters or whitespace need to be quoted in the
value of the environment variable.

=item GIT_PBUILDER_OUTPUT_DIR

Where to put the result of the build.  The default is C<..> (the parent
directory).  This setting is ignored if GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF is set to
C<no>.

=item GIT_PBUILDER_PDEBUILDOPTIONS

Add additional options for B<pdebuild> itself (such as
B<--use-pdebuild-internal>).  The contents of this variable will undergo
shell expansion, so any arguments containing shell metacharacters or
whitespace need to be quoted in the value of the environment variable.

=item PBUILDER_BASE

Set this environment variable to change the default location for the
pbuilder tgz files (F</var/cache/pbuilder>) when BUILDER is set to
C<pbuilder>.
